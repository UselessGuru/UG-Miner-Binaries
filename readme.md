Location for UG-Miner binaries

All releases are the zip files from their original source, hosted here to allow for automated downloading.

No miner miner binaries have been modified.

Some .bat / .cmd files in the miner packages have been modified to better support UG-Miners requirements.

Some miner packages stored in their original location password protected. UG-Miner cannot handle pwd protected miner packages. These packages are stored here with their password removed.

Some miners are no longer available at their original sources.
